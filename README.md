# GeekieBot
This is a Discord.py Bot
If you want to run the bot download Python3.8 after that look up on YouTube how to make you're own discord bot because you need to make an discord dev portal application. After that just dubble click the .bat file. This will start the bot and it will be online. 


If you want to customize code download as an zip and edit the python file  :)


Thanks and greeting from GeekieCoder!
